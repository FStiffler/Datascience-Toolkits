# Report: Milestone 1

## Task 1: Data

## Task 2: Codebase

The code base which was assigned to us can be found [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/vision/mnist_convnet.py). It is a python file from the github repo of the keras-team. The provided URL of the codebase allowed us to download the file with the terminal command:

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/vision/mnist_convnet.py

```
