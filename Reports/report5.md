# Report: Milestone 5         

## Task 1

The first task was to follow this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-flask-application-using-docker-o n-ubuntu-18-04) to learn more about flask. So we did that.

We had to made sure to install Nginx as described in step one [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04) because it is a requirement to get flask running. 

After we read through the tutorial, we decided to apply the learnings right away in task 2.
